Delete Entries: The added entries are deleted by a button , allowing user to delete the entries as per their preferences.



Data Handling:

Saving Data: All added website URLs, usernames, and passwords are saved locally within the console. This means the data is temporarily stored in the browser's console for the current session.
No Database Connection: This application does not connect to any external database. Therefore, the data is not permanently stored or accessible after the browser session ends.



Security Considerations:

Local Storage Only: Since the data is saved in the console and not in a database, it remains local to the user's session and is not exposed to external servers or databases.
Session-Limited: The data will be lost once the browser is closed or the page is refreshed, ensuring that sensitive information is not retained.
This simple yet functional website serves as a handy tool for managing multiple login credentials temporarily during a browsing session, with an emphasis on local storage and no external data transmission.
